## 💾 RAM vs ROM – Understanding Memory Types

| Term   | Full Name                | Function                                               | Volatile? | Examples                                 |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| RAM    | Random Access Memory     | Temporary memory used while the computer is running   | ✅ Yes    | Running programs, browsing, games        |
| ROM    | Read-Only Memory         | Stores essential instructions for startup (booting)   | ❌ No     | BIOS/UEFI, firmware                       |

### 🔹 RAM (Random Access Memory)

- Temporary memory used by active programs and processes.
- Very fast, but **volatile** (data is lost when the power is off).
- Example: When you open a browser or a game, it loads into RAM.

### 🔹 ROM (Read-Only Memory)

- Permanent memory that stores firmware or system startup code.
- **Non-volatile**: keeps its data even when the computer is off.
- Example: The BIOS/UEFI that initializes hardware when starting the computer.

✅ **In summary**:
> RAM is fast and temporary — it helps while you're working.  
> ROM is fixed and permanent — it helps the system start up.
