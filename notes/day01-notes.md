## 🔸 1. Data 

- **Definition**: Raw facts, numbers, or symbols without context.
- **Examples**:  
  - "42", "green", "08:00", "A", "100101"

🔍 *Data is like unprocessed material — it has no meaning by itself.*

---

## 🔸 2. Information 

- **Definition**: Processed or organized data that has meaning.
- **Examples**:  
  - "Temperature is 42°C"  
  - "Meeting is at 08:00 AM"  
  - "Green means traffic is allowed"

🔍 *Information = Data + Meaning*

| Processing    | Unprocessed, unanalyzed                      | Processed and analyzed                    |
| Meaning       | Has no meaning                               | Has meaning                               |
| Source        | Collected directly                           | Derived from data                         |

## 🔸 3. Knowledge 

- **Definition**: Understanding patterns, relationships, or rules based on information.
- **Examples**:  
  - "If the temperature reaches 42°C, the system must activate cooling."
  - "Green light means go, red means stop."

🔍 *Knowledge = Applying logic and experience to information*

---

## 🔸 4. Wisdom

- **Definition**: The ability to make sound decisions based on knowledge and experience.
- **Examples**:  
  - "Based on past trends, we delay outdoor work when the temperature exceeds 40°C."
