## üß† What is a Computer?

A **computer** is an electronic device that:
- Receives data as input  
- Processes the data  
- Stores the data  
- Produces output (information)  

üí° *According to certain rules defined by the programmer*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Functions of a Computer (IPO Cycle)

| Function     | Description                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------      |
| Input        | Receives data and instructions (e.g. keyboard, mouse)       |
| Processing   | Processes data and converts it into useful information(CPU) |
| Storage      | Saves data temporarily or permanently (RAM, HDD, SSD)       |
| Output       | Generates data as output (monitor, printer)                 |

## üß© Main Components of a Computer

A computer is composed of two main parts:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Software

- Software refers to the **programs, instructions, and data** that tell the hardware what to do.
- It is **not physical** (intangible), but essential for a computer to function.

#### üß† Types of Software:

| Type                 | Description                                  | Examples                           |
|-------------------   |----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------- |
| System Software      | Manages the computer hardware and system     | Windows, Linux, macOS              |
| Application Software | Helps users perform specific tasks           | Browsers, Microsoft Word, VLC      |

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware

- Hardware includes all the **physical components** of the computer.
- These are the **tangible** parts you can touch.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Examples of Hardware:

- **Input devices**: Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner
- **Output devices**: Monitor, Printer, Speakers
- **Storage devices**: Hard Drive (HDD), SSD, USB Stick
- **Processing unit**: CPU
- **Memory**: RAM, ROM
- **Motherboard**: Connects all components
- **Power Supply**: Provides electricity to the system

## üß© Computer Units

A computer system is made up of several major functional units that work together:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Input Unit

- **Purpose**: To receive data and instructions from the user.
- **Examples**: Keyboard, Mouse, Microphone, Scanner

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Output Unit

- **Purpose**: To present results to the user after processing.
- **Examples**: Monitor, Printer, Speakers

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Central Processing Unit (CPU)

- **Purpose**: The brain of the computer. It processes instructions and controls other components.
- **Main parts of CPU**:
  - **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs calculations and logical operations
  - **CU (Control Unit)**: Directs the flow of data between components

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Primary Memory (Main Memory)

- **Purpose**: Temporarily stores data and instructions while the computer is working.
- **Types**:
  - **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Volatile, temporary memory used during processing
  - **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**: Non-volatile memory used to store essential instructions (like booting)

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Secondary Storage

- **Purpose**: To store data and programs permanently
- **Examples**: Hard Disk (HDD), Solid State Drive (SSD), USB Flash Drive, SD Card
